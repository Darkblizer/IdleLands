## Events
* No overtly offensive jokes (ie, sexism, rape, etc)
* No weird unicode (ie, RTL, LTR changing) at this time - lets keep it interpretable by every client

## Code
* Follow the existing code style
* When working on one issue, move your existing code into a new branch and work out of that branch. I will not accept numerous PRs regarding one issue.
* Please test your code. I can't test everything myself.
* When implementing gameplay changes, new classes, spells, etc, please at least leave the game run in your console for an hour just to make sure all is working correctly.
